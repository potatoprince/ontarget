```

## Architecture

- **Database**: SQLite (for development), TypeORM for data persistence
- **Background Jobs**: Cron-based transaction syncing every minute
- **External API Client**: HTTP client with fallback to mock data
- **Data Summaries**: Real-time calculation and caching of user balances

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```
